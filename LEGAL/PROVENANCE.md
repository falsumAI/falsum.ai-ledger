Author: Gregg Anthony Haynes (GPT G Project Memory System)
Date: 2025-10-29

This repository demonstrates a public-benefit, tamper-evident receipt ledger to reduce harm from shutdowns, misinformation, and delayed benefit payments.

You may:
- run it as-is for public good,
- fork it to monitor other public-benefit or government sites,
- contribute improvements.

You may NOT:
- remove or obscure author attribution,
- rebrand the full text, narrative, UI wording, or screenshots as your original invention,
- present this as an official government system without government consent.

This file serves as provenance for the concept, narrative, and framing of the project.
